# AthleteSTTracker
Main Goal: Create an easily accessible program that records, predicts, and displays data on athletes which can be useful for strength and conditioning. I want this program to be utilized by and for my school’s strength and conditioning program


# Project goals: 
- Create an interface where trainers can input their athletes data to keep track
  - * Trainer sets reps for each athlete
    * Athlete records what they do
    * If higher than projected, update their goal
    * Example: On a set day, instead of 5 reps, we’d want 155 till failure, if they do more than 5, it would up their average for future                   reps. If they do 155, 5 times, 85% for 5 reps is 10/10. If they do 7 or 3 (less or more) reps then it is a 8 or 9 out of 10                 workout and we change the weight
   
# Project features:
- Have a section for trainer login, and student login so trainers can set workouts for students
- Workout planner
  - * Trainers design workouts, reps, weights, how many rounds, and goal
    * Students have to be able to record their weight and reps, and if they didn’t do it
    * Students should be able to designate their trainer or their team
    * Trainers should be able to organize students by team
    * Create login page with gender, team, height, position, Age, class, last recorded weight

# Programs to utilize/checkout:
- Fire base
- API
- Spring boot
- SQL light
- Flask (backend)
- D3 (graphs)

# Initial problems:
- Deployment may be an issue
  - Deploying flask: greengeeks.com (small price), pythonanywhere.com (free and easy)

# Examples to look at for inspiration:
- Team builder app (upload workout
  - Team builder has easy join codes for the athletes made by the trainers. The trainers should have to put in the info, not the athletes.
  - Features of team bulder: Mobile app, TV modules, Program templates, Tablets that track athletes ON the rig, Tracking your max, Auto generated reports, Testing, Goals and standards testing, Current news, Video uploading for coach feedback
  - An example of a project already made helps me analyze what I should prioritize in my program for Regis, specially designed for them. Need to ask more questions.
  
# Steps:
- Start by making the program in Java like our previous projects,
- Create an html interface, connecting the Java project into the backend

# Current Focus:
- Create Login and New User methods
- New Users should input their posiiton (Trainer/Athlete), Sports Team (Given options), First and last name, Age, Weight, Height, Birth gender
- Trainers do not need to input their stats as they do not need to be recorded, only that they will control the athletes

- ASK MORE QUESTIONS TO SEE WHAT I NEED TO PRIORITIZE IN MY PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY FOR MY COLLEGE
